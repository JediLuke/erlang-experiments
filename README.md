JediLuke's Erlang experiments
=============================

This repo is a place to dump my numerous little experiments in Erlang, as well as some useful Erlang modules that don't really deserve their own repo.

Incomplete list of things in this repo
---------------

* robey: A wrapper to have OO like object handling without sacrificing immutability
* Integrations: Working example of integrating c code with Erlang
* Concurrency tests: Experiments from when I first started Erlang, learning about the concurrency model. Originally my code was always blocking, before I learned how to properly spawn children from a supervisor.
* ex_com: gen_server with commenting style that I really like
* neuron.erl: Unfinished basic model for a simple neuron
